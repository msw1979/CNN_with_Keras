# CNN_with_Keras
Example of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) using Keras.
The MNIST data was used in this example. The code uses Neural Network with two 2D convolution with ReLu activation and max pooling, hidden layer (with 100 neurons) and Relu activation, flattening, and an output dense layer with softmax activation. The code calculates the training and validation loss, and accuracy and percent error for the validation data. It also generates the classified and misclassified images. The following figure show the training and validation loss and accuracy versus epoch.
